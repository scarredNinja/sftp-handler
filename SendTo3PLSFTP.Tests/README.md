# Assessment

This project covers the tests for the SFTP handler.

It is not complete and only handles the SFTP Upload process - this was due to time constraints.

## Considerations

I would ensure that code coverage is min. 80% and should cover the testable scenarios in:

-> Receiving the HTTP request
-> Getting the Dispatch Request from the DB
-> Creating and validating the CSV file
-> Sending the file to the SFTP
